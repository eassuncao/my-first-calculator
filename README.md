Simple calculator in c++

About this calculator:

This calculator supports six types of operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and root.

It supports two numbers per calculation, the first comes before the operator and the second after the operator (the number that will be used by the operator).

Integers and decimal numbers are supported, but other types such as fractions are not.

How to use this calculator:

The program starts by asking the user to input the first number. Enter the first number and press Enter.

Then, the program asks the user to enter the operator. Input the operator, then hit Enter.

Lastly, the program asks the user to input the second number, or the number upon which the operator will act.
E.g., if your first number is 6, you pick the / operator, and your second number is 2, the program will
calculate 6/2, which is equal to 3. If you enter 5, then ^, then 2, the program will give you 25 as the result.

After inputting the first number, the operator, and the second number, the program will return the result.
